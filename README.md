# ITP-Summer-Project
This repository contains the report and the final presentation of the summer project of the Information Technology Program of the Aalto University Business School.


The client of the project is the City of Espoo. The specific task at hand is to develop a guideline for an operating data  sharing model to enable co-creation of better 
services  within Espoo. This report looks through the lens of mobility  and identifying the municipality's possible role in the data  sharing ecosystem.  Throughout our 
qualitative research we have consulted  with industry professionals and stakeholders to develop a guideline for an operating model regarding data sharing at  the City of 
Espoo. The operating model takes note of  regulations, governance, roles, processes, and challenges.  The final deliverables of the operating model and example  case 
uses were delivered in a final presentation event on  August 30th in Otaniemi. The project was presented during  the meeting with the operating model and example use  
cases. After the meeting the report was delivered to the client.
