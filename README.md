# ðŸ“Š ITP Summer Project â€“ Data Sharing for Smarter Services
**Client:** City of Espoo
**Program:** Aalto University School of Business â€“ Information Technology Program (ITP)
**Focus Area:** Smart Mobility & Data Sharing Ecosystems

Welcome to the repository for our ITP Summer Project, where we collaborated with the City of Espoo to explore how municipalities can better leverage data to co-create smarter, citizen-centric services.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
How can a city become a more effective participant in a data-sharing ecosystem?
That was the core question we tackled in this 3-month consulting project. Our focus: building a practical and actionable operating model for data sharing, through the lens of urban mobility.

Through stakeholder interviews, ecosystem research, pinpoint analysis, and policy review, we developed a data sharing guideline that addresses:

* Governance & regulatory frameworks

* Roles & responsibilities of different stakeholders

* Key processes and technical considerations

* Challenges and opportunities in municipal data sharing

The outcome is a structured yet flexible operating model that municipalities like Espoo can adapt to different data use casesâ€”starting with mobility and extending to other city services.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters
In an increasingly digital world, public sector organizations need robust frameworks to share data ethically and effectively. This project contributes to that mission by giving Espoo a clear roadmap to participate in and lead collaborative data ecosystems.

## ðŸŽ¥ Final Presentation
Catch the highlights and recommendations in our final presentation delivered on August 30th, 2023 in Otaniemi, where we showcased our operating model and mobility-based example use cases.
